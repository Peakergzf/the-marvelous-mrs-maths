## Question 1

Given the number of NBA playoff games a player played in a season, can we (if yes, how to) determine which rounds (R1, CSF, CF, F) his team advanced to?

For example, the highlighted column in the table below (from [here](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/duncati01.html)) 
shows the number of playoff games Tim Duncan played in each season of his career.

It turns out that some of the numbers can, others don't, see the codes for more details.
